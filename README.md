# Burger App

![Title Page](public/assets/img/main.PNG)

Burger-aholics allows users to create a burger, add it to the menu, and "devour it" using on screen buttons.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
NPM Packages:
express
express-handlebars
body-parser
mySQL
path
```
use "npm install packageName --save" in terminal to run application on your localhost:3000 webpage

### Thoughts, Comments, Concerns

This application was my first experience using different js files to house different functions of the server and page functionality. I used express for routing, handlebars to create dynamic HTML, and mySQL to store and update data.
